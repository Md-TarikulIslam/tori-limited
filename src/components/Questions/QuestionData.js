    question: "Should You Create A Mobile Or A Web App?",
    answer:
      "Both have their benefits and flaws. Mobile apps are surely more expensive but can provide you with many more data collecting, monetisation capabilities than web applications. Progressive Web Apps are a good compromise between a mobile and web app â€” you can learn more about PWA on our blog. But remember that sooner or later you may need both mobile and web app and when that moment comes we are here for you :)",
